# .agents/rules/

Path-scoped rules for agents. Files in this directory may carry frontmatter with a `paths:` glob; Claude Code loads them only when the agent reads a file matching one of the globs. Codex and Gemini ignore this directory today — those harnesses use AGENTS.md plus per-skill SKILL.md instead.

This directory is intentionally empty. Add a rule here only when there is a real per-path constraint worth scoping (e.g. "when editing `cli/help.ts`, also update `references/command-catalog.md`"). Keep each rule under 100 lines.

Frontmatter format (Claude Code convention):

```markdown
---
paths:
  - "cli/help.ts"
  - "cli/commands/**/*.ts"
---

When editing these files, also update the matching `references/command-catalog.md` and re-run the head-to-head bench.
```

See `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` for the conventions that govern these files.
